# TimeFrame
describing TimeFrame ... and how it was achieved
TimeFrame a narrative combined with series of interactions among human with humans, humans with machine and machines with human. In this narrative I am trying to convey a message related to the changes a human goes through. These changes occur when we interact with other beings, face to face / on machines; and then the reflection of those changes shown to us by the machines. It is a confused state of affairs I must admit, such as the existence of reality ... 
This narrative was divided into two.five phases. Phase .five: One of my passions is weaving which lead me, to do paper weave, some digital work developed for a previous exhibition can be viewed below in reference two. Then Phase One can be viewed in the image gallery and video clips as progress towards the project. In this phase I started working with ofxOpenCv addon did some experimentations (those experimentations will be later uploaded). In Phase Two working with ofxOpticalFlowFarneback gave me the exact results that I wanted to view for my final ""final"" project. This addon as I am calling is OFF gave me the results of a weave-like effects, and then further kept exploring OFF and finalized my work. The two addons opencv and opticalflowfarneback are merged in a very unusual manner. The openCV is viewed as a video playing while the viewer is interacting with the webcam with the OFF being projected on the screen.
